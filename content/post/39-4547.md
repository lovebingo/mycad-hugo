### 参考文件  
 FAA AD 2004-14-20，修正案： 39-13729，2004年 7月 1日颁发。  
  
### 原因、措施和规定 本适航指令替代 CAD2003-C525-01，39-4219  
本指令的颁发是由于赛斯纳公司对受CAD2003-C525-01影响的配平印刷电路组件的设计进行了改进，并允许使用该组件以避免单点失效。同时，赛斯纳公司发现还有其他序号的飞机也存在原指令所指出的不安全状态。电子俯仰配平系统的单点失效可导致在俯仰配平失控状态下驾驶员无法用驾驶杆上 “自动驾驶/配平 ”关断开关断开电子俯仰配平系统。电子俯仰配平系统的失效还可能导致大的配平失误，并使驾驶员无法超控。  
本指令的颁发就是要纠正电子俯仰配平系统的单点失效，并要求完成 FAA AD 2004-14-20（修正案：39-13729，2004年7月1日颁发）要求的工作。  
完成本指令可采取能保证安全的替代方法或调整完成的时间，但必须得到适航当局的同意。 附件：FAA AD 2004-14-20（修正案：39-13729，2004年7月1日颁发）  
Regulatory Information  
2004-14-20 The Cessna Aircraft Company: Amendment 39-13729; Docket No. 2003-CE-54-AD; Supersedes AD 2003-21-07; Amendment 39-13342.  
When Does This AD Become Effective?  
(a) This AD becomes effective on August 23, 2004. What Other ADs Are Affected by This Action?  
(b) This AD supersedes AD 2003-21-07. What Airplanes Are Affected by This AD?  
(c) This AD affects Model 525 airplanes with the following serial numbers that are certificated in any category:  
(1) Group 1 (maintains the actions from AD 2003-21-07): 525-0001, 525-0002, and 525-0004 through 525-0159.  
(2) Group 2: 525-0160 through 525-0359. What Is the Unsafe Condition Presented in This AD?  
(d) This AD is the result of Cessna having now developed and made changes in the design of the affected trim printed circuit board (PCB) assembly to allow the use of the assembly and the prevention of the single-point failure, and identification of additional airplanes that have the same unsafe condition. The actions  
  
specified in this AD are intended to correct this single- point failure in the electric pitch trim system, which will result in a runaway pitch trim condition where the pilot could not disconnect using the control wheel autopilot/trim disconnect switch. Failure of the electric trim system would result in a large pitch mistrim and would cause excessive control forces that the pilot could not overcome.  
What Must I Do To Address This Problem?  
(e) To address this problem, you must do the following:  
Actions  Compliance  Procedures  
(1) For Group 1 airplanes only: Disengage the PITCH TRIM circuit breaker located on the left circuit breaker panel. Install a tie strap (part number (P/N) MS3367-1-4 or equivalent part number) on the shaft of the PITCH TRIM circuit breaker to prevent the circuit breaker from being engaged.  Within 5 calendar days or 10 hours time-in-service after October 22, 2003 (the effective date of AD 2003-21-07), whichever occurs first.  Not Applicable.  
(2) For Group 1 airplanes only: Disengage the AP SERVOS circuit breaker located in the right circuit breaker panel. Install a tie strap (P/N MS3367-1-4 or equivalent part number) on the shaft of the AP SERVOS circuit breaker from being engaged.  Within 5 calendar days or 10 hours time-in-service after October 22, 2003 (the effective date of AD 2003-21-07), whichever occurs first.  Not Applicable.  
(3) The Minimum Crew portion of Section II--Operating Limitations of the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) provides information on applicable operating limitations with the  Not Applicable.  Not Applicable.  
autopilot inoperable.  
(4) All affected airplanes were originally equipped with a P/N 6518351-3 or P/N 65138351-5 Trim PCB Assembly. If a P/N 6518351-8 Trim PCB Assembly is installed, contact the Wichita Aircraft Certification Office at the address in paragraph (f) of this AD to determine if the installed P/N 6518351-8 Trim PCB assembly is an alternative method of compliance to this AD.  Not Applicable.  Not Applicable.  
(5) Cessna Citation Alert Service Letter ASL525-27-02, dated October 10, 2003, contains information related to this subject.  Not Applicable.  Not Applicable.  
(6) For both Group 1 and Group 2 airplanes: Do the trim PCB assembly change as follows: (i) Modify the 6518351-8 trim PCB assembly to a 6518351-10 trim PCB assembly; or. (ii) Replace any 6518351-3 or 6518351-5 trim PCB assembly with a 6518351-10 (EX) trim PCB assembly.  Within the next 24 calendar months after August 23, 2004 (the effective date of this AD) or within 300 hours time-in-service (TIS) after August 23, 2004 (the effective date of this AD), whichever occurs first, unless already done.  Follow the ACCOMPLISH MENT INSTRUCTION S paragraph of Cessna Citation Service Bulletin No. SB525- 27-17, dated December 9, 2003.  
(7) For both Group 1 and Group 2 airplanes: Remove any tie strap (P/N MS3367-1- 4 or equivalent part number) on the AP SERVOS and PITCH TRIM circuit breakers. (Required by AD 2003-21-07.).  Before further flight after the modification or replacement of the trim PCB assembly required by paragraph (e)(6)(i) or (e)(6)(ii) of this AD.  Follow the ACCOMPLISH MENT INSTRUCTION S paragraph of Cessna Citation Service Bulletin No.  
SB525-  27-17, dated December 9, 2003.  
(8) For both Group 1 Group 2 airplanes: Do not install any 6518351-8, 6518351-3, or 6518351-5 trim PCB assembly.  As of August 23, 2004 (the effective  date of this AD).  Not Applicable.

 Comments  
CORRECTION: There is a mistake in the Federal Register, pg 41922, col 2, compliance table (1), of AD 2004-14-20. It should read: "Within 5 calendar days or 10 hours time-in-service after October 22, 2003 (the effective date of AD 2003-21-07), whichever occurs first." The FR will issue a correction. We've corrected this copy.
