### 原因、措施和规定 本适航指令替代 CAD2003-C208-01，39-3930 
CAD2003-C208-02，39-4218 
本指令替代CAD2003-C208-01，修正案号：39-3930，2003年1月29日颁发和CAD2003-C208-02，修正案号：39-4218，2003年11月13日颁发。 
    本指令的颁发是由于：1、CAD2003-C208-01（参考FAA AD 2002-22-17颁发）颁发后，Cessna设计了新的襟翼双臂摇臂，寿命为40,000个起落（原寿命为7,000个起落）；2、CAD2003-C208-02（参考FAA AD 2003-21-04颁发）颁发后，对所有双臂摇臂就裂纹、焊接丢失或缺损做了进一步的分析和试验。 
裂纹、变形、焊接丢失或缺损可能引起双臂摇臂失效，从而导致襟翼系统及周围结构损伤，使飞机降低或失去可控性。为防止此类事件的再次发生，自本指令生效之日起，要求完成附件中FAA AD2004-17-01中分别针对第1组飞机和第2组飞机要求的工作。 
完成本指令可采取能保证安全的替代方法或调整完成时间，但必须得到适航部门的批准。 
附件：FAA AD 2004-17-01 
2004-17-01 Cessna Aircraft Company: Amendment 39-13772; Docket No. 2002-CE-23-AD; Supersedes AD 2002-22-17, amendment 39-12944; and AD 2003-21-04, amendment 39-13339. 
When Does This AD Become Effective? 
(a) This AD becomes effective on September 26, 2004. 
What Other ADs Are Affected by This Action? 
(b) This AD supersedes AD 2002-22-17, amendment 39-12944; and AD 2003-21-04, amendment 39-13339. 
What Airplanes Are Affected by This AD? 
(c) This AD affects the following airplane models and serial numbers that are certificated in any category: 
(1) Group 1 (retains the actions from AD 2003-21-04, and adds all flap bellcranks to the applicability): 
(2) Group 2 (retains the requirement of AD 2002-22-17 that you repetitively inspect the inboard forward flap bellcranks for cracks, eventually replace these bellcranks, and provides the option of installing the new design flap bellcrank to increase the life limits and terminate the repetitive inspections): Models 208 and 208B airplanes, all serial numbers. 
What Is the Unsafe Condition Presented in This AD? 
(d) This AD is the result of (since FAA issued AD 2002-22-17) Cessna's design of a new flap bell crank with a life limit of 40,000 landings (instead of 7,000 landings), and (since FAA issued AD 2003- 21-04) further analysis and examination of cracks and missing/ incomplete welds in all of the bell cranks. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent failure of any bellcrank due to cracks, deformation, or missing/incomplete welds. This failure could lead to damage to the flap system and surrounding structure and result in reduced or loss of control of the airplane. 
What Must I Do To Address This Problem for Group 1 Airplanes?
