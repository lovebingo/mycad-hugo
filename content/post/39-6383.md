### 参考文件  
1、FAA AD 2009-15-05，2009年 7月 6日颁发；  
 2、Cessna公司服务通告 SB CAB08-9,2008年 11月 24日。  
  
### 原因、措施和规定  
本指令的颁发，源于两起关于连接钢索松弛造成锻造球体脱离鼓轮凹槽的事件报告。颁发本指令的目的是为了发现和纠正松弛的连接钢索夹，因为钢索松弛会使锻造球体从伺服鼓轮的凹槽中脱离，并和钢索的保险销接触。这种失效会造成方向舵和/或副翼的操作受限，并进一步造成飞机的失控。  
自本指令生效之日起，要求完成附件FAA AD 2009-15-05（2009年7月6日颁发）中要求的工作，除非已事先完成。  
完成本指令可采取能保证安全的等效替代方法或调整时间完成，但必须得到适航当局的批准。  
附件：FAA AD 2009-15-05（2009年7月6日颁发） 2009-15-05 Cessna Aircraft Company: Amendment 39-15968; Docket No. FAA-2009-0638; Directorate Identifier 2009-CE-038-AD. Effective Date  
(a) This AD becomes effective on July 27, 2009.  
Affected ADs  
(b) None.  
Applicability  
(c) This AD applies to the following airplane models and serial numbers that are certificated in any category:  
  
Model  Serial Numbers  
208  20800500 through 20800504  
208B  208B1216, 208B2001, 208B2003 through 208B2023, 208B2025 through 208B2029, 208B2031 through 208B2037, 208B2040, 208B2042, and 208B2043  
Unsafe Condition  
(d) This AD is the result of two reported incidences of slack bridle cables with the swaged balls unseated from their drum recesses. We are issuing this AD to detect and correct loose bridle cable clamps, which could result in the swaged ball unseating from the recess in the servo drum and contacting the cable guard pin. This failure could lead to very limited control of the rudder and/or aileron with consequent loss of control.  
Compliance  
(e) To address this problem, you must do the following, unless already done:  Alternative Methods of Compliance (AMOCs)  
Actions  Compliance  Procedures  
(1) Measure and adjust as necessary, the roll bridle cable tension and yaw bridle cable tension, and torque the 12 bridle cable clamp screws.  Within the next 10 hours time-in-service after July 27, 2009 (the effective date of this AD).  Follow Accomplishment Instructions, paragraphs 2. through 7., of Cessna Aircraft Company Caravan Service Bulletin CAB08-9, dated November 24, 2008.

Within 10 days after the inspection required in paragraph (e)(1). If Cessna Aircraft Company Caravan Service Bulletin CAB08-9, dated November 24, 2008, was done before July 27, 2009 (the effective date of this AD) the report is not required.  Send the report to the FAA at the address specified in paragraph (f) of this AD.
