### 适用范围  
本指令适用于序列号从525-0600至525-0662的型号为塞斯纳525的所有飞机。  
  
<!--more-->  
### 参考文件  
    1.FAA AD 2008-12-01，39-15544，2008年 5月 27日颁发；  
    2.塞斯纳飞机公司引用服务信函 SL525-71-05，第 1版，2008年 2月 6日。  
  
### 原因、措施和规定  
本指令的颁发是因为收到报告，在某些Cessna525飞机的生产过程中，其后防火隔板组件与密封组件之间很可能没有用防火隔板密封填料。颁发本指令的目的是为了发现和改正飞机后防火隔板组件与密封组件之间遗漏的填料，因为这会导致防止火焰从防火隔板缺口蔓延的灭火系统失效，导致火势失控。  
    自本指令生效之日起，要求完成所附FAA适航指令2008-12-01规定的工作，除非已事先完成。  
    完成本指令可采取能确保安全的替代方法或调整时间，但必须得到适航部门的批准。  
    附件： 2008-12-01 Cessna Aircraft Company: Amendment 39-15544;  
  
Docket No. FAA-2008-0306; Directorate Identifier 2008-CE-014-AD.  
Effective Date  
(a) This AD becomes effective on July 16, 2008.  
Applicability  
(c) This AD applies to Model 525 airplanes, serial numbers 525-0600 through 525-0662, that are certificated in any category.  
Affected ADs  
(b) None.  
Unsafe Condition  
(d) This AD results from a report that firewall sealant may not have been applied between the aft firewall assembly and seal assembly during manufacture of certain Model 525 airplanes. We are issuing this AD to detect and correct missing firewall sealant between the aft firewall assembly and seal assembly, which could result in failure of the fire extinguishing system to prevent the spread of fire through the firewall gap. This failure could lead to an uncontrolled fire.  
Compliance  
(e) To address this problem, you must do the following, unless already done: Actions Compliance Procedures  
(1) Inspect between the 6352225 aft firewall assembly and 6352226 seal assembly for missing firewall sealant.  Within the next 60 hours time-in-service (TIS) after July 16, 2008 (the effective  
  
  
date of this AD) or within 60 days after July 16, 2008 (the effective date of this AD), whichever occurs first. Follow Cessna Aircraft Company Citation Service Letter SL525-71-05, Revision 1, dated February 6, 2008.  
(2) If, as a result of the inspection required by paragraph (e)(1) of this AD, you find there is missing firewall sealant between the 6352225 aft firewall assembly and 6352226 seal assembly, seal with U000117S firewall sealant in the gap between the 6352225 aft firewall assembly and 6352226 seal assembly. Before further flight after the inspection required by paragraph (e)(1) of this AD. Follow Cessna Aircraft Company Citation Service Letter SL525-71-05, Revision 1, dated February 6, 2008.
